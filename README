Simple airport control program made for Makers Academy Week 3 test

Currently includes:

        * airport_spec.rb
        * plane_spec.rb
        * grand_finale_spec.rb
        * airport.rb
        * plane.rb
        * weather.rb
        * airport_plane.rb

The randomly generated weather currently has a 1 in 5 chance of being stormy.  You can make it more likely to be stormy by changing the integer on line 8 of the weather.rb module to something higher than 3, up to a maximum of 9.

The airport_plane.rb file is simply a helper document for loading all requirements into IRB in one go - it has no functionality beyond that.

Note: dev branch for messing around with extra features 
        - fixed bug where multiples of the same planes could land and take off after having already landed or already taken off.
        - made program more verbal telling you what it's doing
        - still want to work out how to test for randomness
